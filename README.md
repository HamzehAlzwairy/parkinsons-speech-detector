# parkinsons-speech-detector

Parkinson’s is usually diagnosed using neurological history information of
the patient along with motor skills tests and observations, it would be useful if
there is a way to diagnose Parkinson’s without visiting the clinic or conducting
any screening. One potential way to do this is using the features of speech
signals, because Parkinson’s also affects voice signals of the patient. Patients
may experience difficulty in spelling words or making sounds, lowered voice tone
and a low pitch range to count a few. For this project, I am going to use a dataset of processed speech signals to
classify processed speech pattern into patterns belonging to a PD patient ’1’
or a healthy individual ’0’. Data was gathered in a study conducted at the
Department of Neurology in Cerrahpa˚AYa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University.
